# Project Name
Quadex

## Summary

I am excited to announce that I am working on building a cost-effective and high-quality drone for a variety of fields. This drone will have a price range of between 
123 dollars to 246 dollars, making it accessible to a wider range of customers.
I am particularly excited about this project because I believe that there is a high demand for cost-effective and high-quality drones that can be used for a variety of
fields, including agriculture, search and rescue operations, and surveying, among others. I am confident that this drone will fill that gap and make a meaningful impact in these fields by providing efficient and effective solutions at an affordable price point.
In summary, I am building a cost-effective and high-quality drone and additional features, and the ability to be used in a variety of fields with a price range of 
between 123 dollars to 246 dollars. I am excited to build it because I believe it will fill a gap in the market and provide an efficient and effective solution at an 
affordable price point.



## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
1. Designing the frame of the drone using CAD software and testing it using a 3D printer.
2. Designing multiple frames for different fields of drone usage.
3. Building all the parts of the drone by myself, including a low-budget power distribution board to understand the drone better and reduce dependence on external imports.
4. Adding safety features to the drone, including the ability to fly in rainy seasons by building a custom frame.
5. Conducting a survey to gather feedback from experienced drone users to improve the design of the drone.
6. Working on the flight controller aspect of the drone with a small team of experienced professionals.
7. Testing new features such as hand gesture control on the drone.
8. Developing a remote app for different devices.
9. Building different types of drones catering to various needs such as commercial, government, personal, kids, and photography.

## Budget

| Product         | Supplier/Link                         | Cost   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
